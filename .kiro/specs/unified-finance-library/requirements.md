# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This unified finance calculations utility library addresses precision issues in monetary calculations by maintaining full mathematical precision internally for all calculations, conversions, and arithmetic operations, The library ensures exact mathematical calculations throughout all operations, with rounding only occurring when formatting values for display purposes using the round half up algorithm (0.5 rounds up to 1, -0.5 rounds up to 0).

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive input validation for both string and number inputs, so that I can catch errors early and provide meaningful feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inputs are null or undefined THEN the system SHALL throw descriptive errors
2. WHEN inputs are not numbers or valid number strings THEN the system SHALL throw descriptive errors
3. WHEN inputs are infinite or NaN THEN the system SHALL throw descriptive errors
4. WHEN amounts would cause integer overflow THEN the system SHALL throw descriptive errors
5. WHEN string inputs cannot be converted to valid numbers THEN the system SHALL throw descriptive errors with the original input value
6. WHEN string inputs contain leading or trailing whitespace THEN the system SHALL accept them as valid if the trimmed content is a valid number

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform safe arithmetic operations on monetary amounts with full precision, so that I can add, subtract, and multiply amounts without precision errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add two amounts THEN the system SHALL return the exact sum maintaining full precision
2. WHEN I subtract two amounts THEN the system SHALL return the exact difference maintaining full precision
3. WHEN I multiply an amount by a factor THEN the system SHALL return the result maintaining full mathematical precision
4. WHEN operations would exceed safe integer limits THEN the system SHALL throw an error
5. WHEN I perform multiple operations THEN intermediate results SHALL maintain full precision throughout the calculation chain

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to convert between different monetary and percentage representations, so that I can work with the most appropriate format for each calculation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a decimal amount THEN the system SHALL convert it to integer cents (monetary amounts are stored as cents internally)
2. WHEN I provide integer cents THEN the system SHALL convert it to decimal amount with full precision
3. WHEN I provide a percentage (0-100 format) THEN the system SHALL convert it to basis points (tax rates are stored as basis points internally)
4. WHEN I provide a percentage (0-1 format) THEN the system SHALL convert it to basis points
5. WHEN I provide basis points THEN the system SHALL convert it to percentage in 0-100 format with full precision
6. WHEN I provide basis points THEN the system SHALL convert it to percentage in 0-1 format with full precision

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to calculate tax amounts and base amounts with mathematical precision, so that I can perform accurate financial calculations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a base amount in cents and tax rate in basis points THEN the system SHALL return the exact mathematical tax amount with full precision
2. WHEN I provide a total amount in cents and tax rate in basis points THEN the system SHALL return the exact mathematical base amount with full precision
3. WHEN tax calculations result in fractional cents THEN the system SHALL maintain the fractional precision throughout calculations
4. WHEN I calculate base amount + tax amount THEN the system SHALL return the exact mathematical result with full precision

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to format monetary amounts and percentages for display, so that users see properly formatted values with configurable precision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I format an amount in cents THEN the system SHALL return a number with exactly 2 decimal places by default
2. WHEN I format an amount with currency symbol THEN the system SHALL return a formatted string with the currency symbol (default: $)
3. WHEN I format a percentage value THEN the system SHALL return a number with exactly 2 decimal places
4. WHEN I format a percentage with symbol THEN the system SHALL return a formatted string with % symbol
5. WHEN formatting requires rounding THEN the system SHALL use round half up rounding (0.5 rounds up to 1, -0.5 rounds up to 0)
6. WHEN formatting produces values like 121.99 after rounding THEN the system SHALL intelligently adjust by 1 cent to 122.00 for easier readability
7. WHEN formatting produces values like 122.01 after rounding THEN the system SHALL intelligently adjust by 1 cent to 122.00 for easier readability
8. WHEN intelligent adjustment would require more than 1 cent change THEN the system SHALL keep the original rounded value
