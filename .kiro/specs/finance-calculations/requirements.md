# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This finance calculations utility library addresses precision issues in monetary calculations by working with integer cents and basis points internally, only rounding at the final display step. The library ensures exact calculations where base amount + tax amount always equals the total amount, eliminating floating-point arithmetic errors common in financial applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to convert between different monetary and percentage representations, so that I can work with the most appropriate format for each calculation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a decimal amount THEN the system SHALL convert it to integer cents
2. WHEN I provide integer cents THEN the system SHALL convert it to decimal amount with exactly 2 decimal places
3. WHEN I provide a percentage (0-100 format) THEN the system SHALL convert it to basis points
4. WHEN I provide a percentage (0-1 format) THEN the system SHALL convert it to basis points
5. WHEN I provide basis points THEN the system SHALL convert it to percentage in 0-100 format
6. WHEN I provide basis points THEN the system SHALL convert it to percentage in 0-1 format
7. IF the conversion would exceed Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER THEN the system SHALL throw an error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to format monetary amounts and percentages for display, so that users see properly formatted values with dollar as default currency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide an amount in cents THEN the system SHALL format it as a number with exactly 2 decimal places
2. WHEN I provide an amount in cents and currency symbol THEN the system SHALL format it with the currency symbol with dollar ($) as the default currency
3. WHEN I specify a locale THEN the system SHALL use that locale for formatting (with 'en-US' as default locale)
4. WHEN I provide a percentage value THEN the system SHALL format it as a number with 2 decimal places
5. WHEN I provide a percentage value for display THEN the system SHALL format it with % symbol at the end
6. WHEN formatting very large amounts THEN the system SHALL handle them without precision loss
7. WHEN I need to clamp percentage values THEN the system SHALL provide functions to clamp between 0-1 and 0-100 ranges

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive input validation, so that I can catch errors early and provide meaningful feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inputs are null or undefined THEN the system SHALL throw descriptive errors
2. WHEN inputs are not numbers THEN the system SHALL throw descriptive errors
3. WHEN inputs are infinite or NaN THEN the system SHALL throw descriptive errors
4. WHEN amounts would cause integer overflow THEN the system SHALL throw descriptive errors
5. WHEN tax rates are outside reasonable bounds THEN the system SHALL throw descriptive errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform safe arithmetic operations on monetary amounts, so that I can add, subtract, and multiply amounts without precision errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add two amounts in cents THEN the system SHALL return the exact sum in cents
2. WHEN I subtract two amounts in cents THEN the system SHALL return the exact difference in cents
3. WHEN I multiply an amount by a factor THEN the system SHALL return the result with proper rounding
4. WHEN operations would exceed safe integer limits THEN the system SHALL throw an error
5. WHEN I perform multiple operations THEN intermediate results SHALL maintain full precision

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to calculate tax amounts and base amounts with exact precision, so that I can determine the tax portion of transactions without rounding errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a base amount in cents and tax rate in basis points THEN the system SHALL return the tax amount in cents such that base + tax equals the expected total
2. WHEN I calculate base amount + calculated tax amount THEN the system SHALL equal exactly the expected total amount
3. WHEN tax calculations result in fractional cents THEN the system SHALL adjust the tax amount to ensure base + tax = total exactly
4. WHEN multiple tax rates apply THEN the system SHALL handle compound tax calculations while maintaining exact totals
5. WHEN I have a base of 2831858 cents with 13% tax THEN the system SHALL return 368142 cents tax amount so that 2831858 + 368142 = 3200000 exactly
6. WHEN rounding is required THEN the system SHALL prioritize maintaining the exact total over mathematical precision of individual components

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to calculate the base amount from a total amount including taxes, so that I can split costs accurately without rounding errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a total amount in cents and tax rate in basis points THEN the system SHALL return a base amount and tax amount that sum exactly to the total
2. WHEN I calculate base amount + tax amount THEN the system SHALL equal exactly the original total amount
3. IF the total amount is 3200000 cents (32,000.00) and tax rate is 1300 basis points (13%) THEN the system SHALL return 2831858 cents (28,318.58) as base amount and 368142 cents (3,681.42) as tax amount where 2831858 + 368142 = 3200000 exactly
4. WHEN the mathematical calculation results in fractional cents THEN the system SHALL adjust the base or tax amount to maintain the exact total
5. WHEN inputs are not finite numbers THEN the system SHALL throw an error with descriptive message
6. WHEN inputs are not integers THEN the system SHALL throw an error with descriptive message
7. WHEN total amount is negative THEN the system SHALL throw an error with descriptive message
8. WHEN tax rate is negative THEN the system SHALL throw an error with descriptive message

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want guaranteed exact precision in all tax breakdown calculations, so that I can rely on the mathematical integrity of financial operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call any tax breakdown function THEN the system SHALL guarantee that baseAmountCents + taxAmountCents = totalAmountCents exactly
2. WHEN mathematical precision would result in fractional cents THEN the system SHALL intelligently adjust amounts to maintain exact totals
3. WHEN displaying amounts with 2 decimal places THEN the system SHALL ensure the displayed base + tax = displayed total
4. WHEN rounding adjustments are made THEN the system SHALL prioritize the accuracy of the total amount over individual component precision
5. WHEN I perform multiple sequential calculations THEN each calculation SHALL maintain exact precision independently
