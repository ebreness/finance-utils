# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This enhancement adds string input support to the finance calculations utility library, allowing functions to accept both string and number inputs for improved developer experience and API flexibility. The library will automatically convert string inputs to numbers while maintaining all existing precision and validation requirements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to pass string values to calculation functions, so that I can work with user input or data from APIs without manual conversion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a string representation of a number to any calculation function THEN the system SHALL convert it to a number and process normally
2. WHEN I provide a number to any calculation function THEN the system SHALL process it without conversion as before
3. WHEN I provide an invalid string (non-numeric) THEN the system SHALL throw a descriptive error
4. WHEN I provide an empty string or whitespace-only string THEN the system SHALL throw a descriptive error
5. WHEN I provide a string with leading/trailing whitespace THEN the system SHALL trim and convert successfully
6. WHEN I provide a string with valid number format (e.g., "123.45", "0.13", "1300") THEN the system SHALL convert and process correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want conversion functions to accept string inputs, so that I can convert user-provided string values directly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call decimalToCents with a string decimal amount THEN the system SHALL convert the string to number and return cents
2. WHEN I call percent100ToBasisPoints with a string percentage THEN the system SHALL convert and return basis points
3. WHEN I call percent1ToBasisPoints with a string percentage THEN the system SHALL convert and return basis points
4. WHEN I provide string inputs to any conversion function THEN all existing validation rules SHALL still apply
5. WHEN I provide malformed string numbers (e.g., "12.34.56", "abc123") THEN the system SHALL throw descriptive errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want calculation functions to accept string inputs, so that I can perform tax calculations with string values from forms or APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call calculateBaseFromTotal with string totalCents and string taxBasisPoints THEN the system SHALL convert both and calculate correctly
2. WHEN I call calculateTaxFromBase with string baseCents and string taxBasisPoints THEN the system SHALL convert both and calculate correctly
3. WHEN I call calculateTaxBreakdown with string inputs THEN the system SHALL convert and return accurate breakdown
4. WHEN I mix string and number inputs in the same function call THEN the system SHALL handle both types correctly
5. WHEN string inputs represent invalid monetary amounts or tax rates THEN the system SHALL throw appropriate validation errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling for string inputs, so that I can provide meaningful feedback to users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN string conversion fails THEN the system SHALL throw an error indicating the invalid string value
2. WHEN converted string values fail existing validation THEN the system SHALL throw the same validation errors as for number inputs
3. WHEN error messages reference input values THEN they SHALL show the original string input for clarity
4. WHEN multiple parameters are strings and one fails THEN the system SHALL identify which parameter caused the error
5. WHEN string inputs are valid but result in calculation errors THEN existing error handling SHALL apply unchanged

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want string input support to maintain backward compatibility, so that existing code continues to work without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing code uses number inputs THEN all functions SHALL work exactly as before
2. WHEN function signatures change to accept string | number THEN TypeScript types SHALL reflect this change
3. WHEN performance is measured THEN string input conversion SHALL have minimal overhead
4. WHEN existing tests run THEN they SHALL pass without modification
5. WHEN new string input tests are added THEN they SHALL verify equivalent behavior to number inputs
